## 💡 About the project

This project is inspired by the world-famous 90’s game Wolfeinstein 3D, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable to explore ray-casting. My goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.

## 🛠️ Compile

> The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

**Using it in your code**

You just need compile code with make:

```shell
make bonus
```

## 📋 Usage

The basic usability is like:

```bash
./cub3d
```
